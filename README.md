            If I had a dollar for every time I thought about you, I’d be a billionaire by now. But, of course, no amount of money could ever measure how much I adore you. You make me laugh, you make me smile, and most importantly, you make my heart do a happy dance every day!
            <br><br>
            Remember when we first met? I thought you were just another cute face. Little did I know, you’d become my favorite person to binge-watch shows with, laugh with, and fall more in love with every single day. You’re my sunshine on rainy days and the sweetest part of my life.
            <br><br>
            So here’s to us, to all the silly moments and to the infinite love we share. You’re the peanut butter to my jelly, the milk to my cookies, and the best part of my every day.
